## Executive Summary

### Objective: To answer key business questions from the flight and airport dataset and provide clear, actionable insights to support investment decisions for BrainStation Mutual Fund.

You work for BrainStation Mutual Fund, where fund managers are evaluating potential investments in one of three major U.S. airline stocks — American Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. Using flight-level and airport data (including flight counts, delays, cancellations, origin airports, fleet size, flight times, and distances), this analysis delivers data-driven insights and demonstrates technical competency in SQL and Tableau.

Visualizations include time-series and monthly trend charts, stacked bars for airport utilization, on-time vs. delayed flight comparisons, highlight tables, state maps of delays, cancellation reason trends, and scatter/aggregate plots for flight distance, fleet size, and per-plane utilization.

Key Findings

Scale and Growth Patterns (2018–2019):
The three carriers display distinct operational strategies and growth trajectories.

Southwest Airlines maintained the highest total flight volume across both years.

Delta Airlines achieved the strongest percentage growth in total distance flown and fleet size.

American Airlines experienced modest growth and a slight decline in efficiency metrics.

Seasonality:
All airlines exhibit clear seasonal demand, with peaks in summer and holiday periods and dips in early-year months. The timing and magnitude of these cycles vary, reflecting route networks and capacity strategies.

Airport Utilization:
The top 10 origin airports account for a large portion of operations:

Delta Airlines is heavily concentrated at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL).

American Airlines operates primarily from Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport (DFW).

Southwest Airlines has a more evenly distributed presence across major airports, signaling a diverse network strategy.

On-Time vs. Delayed Flights (2019):
A calculated field (treating negative or missing delay values as On-Time) revealed:

Highest delays: June 2019

Lowest delays: September 2019

Cancellations:
Cancellations caused by weather peak in winter and early spring, while carrier or crew-related issues are less seasonal. A notable rise in March 2019 aligns with the global grounding of Boeing 737 Max aircraft.

Flight Distance and Efficiency:
A scatter plot of average flight time vs. average distance shows a strong linear relationship, with most flights between 50–150 minutes. Outliers likely correspond to long-haul island destinations (e.g., Hawaii).

When measuring efficiency as distance flown per aircraft:

Delta Airlines leads in utilization efficiency, supported by longer average stage lengths but likely faces higher operating costs per mile.

Southwest Airlines operates shorter routes with consistent volume, suggesting a cost-effective, high-frequency model.

American Airlines appears focused on cost control and yield management, flying fewer but potentially more premium routes.

Investment Insight & Recommendation

Based on operational efficiency, growth momentum, and network strategy, Delta Airlines stands out as the strongest investment candidate. It demonstrates balanced growth in fleet size and distance flown, high utilization efficiency, and consistent performance across airports.

Southwest Airlines remains a strong alternative for stability and cost efficiency, supported by a large flight volume and diversified airport presence. However, its slower growth rate may limit upside potential.

American Airlines, while stable, shows weaker efficiency metrics and modest year-over-year performance improvements compared to Delta and Southwest.

Recommendation:
Invest in Delta Airlines (DAL) — it combines operational growth, strong utilization, and scalable efficiency, making it the most promising long-term performer among the three.
