## Key Business Questions

### **Question 1 ‚Äî Operational Overview**
1. How do the three carriers compare in total number of flights between 2018 and 2019?

3. What are the top 10 origin airports, and how are flights distributed among the carriers?

### **Question 2 ‚Äî On-Time Performance & Cancellations**
1. What proportion of flights are delayed vs. on-time (negative or missing delays treated as on-time)?  
2. Which states experience the highest average departure delays per quarter?  
3. What are the major trends in flight cancellations and their causes (e.g., weather, carrier, NAS, security)?

### **Question 3 ‚Äî Fleet & Distance Efficiency**
1. What is the relationship between flight time and distance?  
2. How do carriers compare year-over-year in total distance flown and fleet size?  
3. Which airline operates most efficiently (average distance per plane)?
